# Using propensity scores, matching, and the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) estimator to analyze the impact of catch shares policy

#### **Disclaimer**: The data used in this blog was synthetically generated for an assignment in my Master's program class on Environmental Policy Evaluation (i.e., data is fake so results have no real implications).

## Question

From 1990 to 2012, what was the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and average treatment effect (ATE) of implementing an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) on the share of years that a fishery was collapsed? For our purposes, "collapsed" is defined as harvest being more than 10% below maximum recorded harvest.

## Background

According to a [2020 article published in the journal Marine Policy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X1930346X), Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) involve the allocation of shares or portions of a total allowable catch (TAC) to individual fishers, vessels, communities or others with an interest in the fishery, such as processors. A number of fisheries around the world have introduced ITQs as a way to regulate fisheries in a sustainable manner, preserving important natural resources while also allowing for increased economic productivity.
